## Arks
```
a library to view books and comment on them,
it has it's custom admin features.. adding, updating, deleting books.
it can search by name, author, topic.
and a custom user model to add a bio and an avatar to your account.
```
try it [here](https://arks.pythonanywhere.com/) and give me your thoughts please.
-----------------------------------------------
the theme is mostly from this [channel](https://www.youtube.com/@TraversyMedia) with a little modification.\
the commented JS in the search_bar.html is working but it doesn't let me add spaces so I used the original search which bothers me a little bit.\
the models can have more fields I just ran out of thoughts.\
I don't think you need the whitenoise, I end up not using it, but if you want to deal with the statics and media in a different way thats fine.
